Some tips:
* Hold Ctrl and click on a component will bring you to the file that exports the component
* Add a console.log('it is re-rendered') right after the useState hook line would be a great place to see if the data is updated
* open the device debugging tool:
  * For Android Ctrl + m (when doing that make sure expo page is on LAN)
  * For IOS Ctrl + d
* double tap R will let you reload android virtual device
* Toggel inspect is a good tool to look at the app layout
